Feature: Generate an AST (Structure file) from a phar file
  In order to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree of the source code from a phar file
  as documentation generating user
  I need to parse the contents of my source tree

#  Scenario: Generate a AST from a phar archive
#    Given I am in the phpDocumentor root directory
#    When I run phpDocumentor against the directory "phar://tests/data/test.phar"
#    Then the exit code should be zero
#    And my AST should contain the file "folder/test.php"
#    And my AST should contain the file "test.php"
#    And my AST should contain 0 class definitions
